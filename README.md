##### IOT_CJ1  
  1. Record the process of the final project  
  2. Study to use the GitHub since it's my first time  
  3. Record the study of the Python and Raspberry Pi 4B  

###### [Weekly Reports]  
  **First week**  
    Learned to use the GitHub and have a general understanding of IoT  
  **Second week**  
    Purchased the Raspberry Pi 4B with a camera and a display screen  
    Try to use the Raspberry Pi and call the camera, since I used to be familiar with C++ and MATLAB in the past, maybe I still need some time to grasp the Python  
  **Third week**  
    Using Raspberry Pi as a controller for air conditioning can be operated remotely through the internet. Besides, it can collect the actual indoor temperature and humidity, and adjust different strategies to control the temperature, humidity, and wind speed in different states, so as to achieve the best real-time control state
  **Fourth week**  
    Installed the Raspberry Pi system, purchased the corresponding temperature sensor, humidity sensor, infrared receiving and sending equipment, became familiar with their control situation
